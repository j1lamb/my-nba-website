# NBA Website
<p>Website uses PHP to automatically to implement my own NBA website so that common structures are generated programmaticially. In this web application I use:</p>

1.) Functions to generate common components such as headers and footers.<br>
2.) Variables to avoid the duplication of values.<br>
3.) Loops to generate repeating structures such as navigation menus.<br>
4.) If statements to control the structure of webpages based on the content present.
