# NBA Website
Website uses PHP to automatically to implement my own NBA website so that common structures are generated programmaticially. In this web application I use:

1.) Functions to generate common components such as headers and footers.
2.) Variables to avoid the duplication of values.
3.) Loops to generate repeating structures such as navigation menus.
4.) If statements to control the structure of webpages based on the content present.
